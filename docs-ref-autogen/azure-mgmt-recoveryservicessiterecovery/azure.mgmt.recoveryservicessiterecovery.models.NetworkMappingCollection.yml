inheritances:

summary: List of network mappings. As with NetworkMapping, it should be possible to
  reuse a prev version of this class. It doesn't seem likely this class could be anything
  more than a slightly bespoke collection of NetworkMapping. Hence it makes sense
  to override Load with Base.NetworkMapping instead of existing CurrentVersion.NetworkMapping.
constructor:
  syntax: 'NetworkMappingCollection(*, value: Optional[List[_models.NetworkMapping]]
    = None, next_link: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs)'
variables:
- description: The Network Mappings list.
  name: value
  types:
  - <xref:list>[<xref:azure.mgmt.recoveryservicessiterecovery.models.NetworkMapping>]
- description: The value of next link.
  name: next_link

  - <xref:str>
