      the lags are turned off.When forecasting, this parameter represents the number
      of rows to lag the target values based

      on the frequency of the data. This is represented as a list or single integer.
      Lag should be used

      when the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable
      do not match up or

      correlate by default. For example, when trying to forecast demand for a product,
      the demand in any

      month may depend on the price of specific commodities 3 months prior. In this
      example, you may want

      to lag the target (demand) negatively by 3 months so that the model is training
      on the correct

      relationship. For more information, see Auto-train a time-series forecast model.Note
      on auto detection of target lags and rolling window size.

      Please see the corresponding comments in the rolling window section.

      We use the next algorithm to detect the optimal target lag and rolling window
      size.Estimate the maximum lag order for the look back feature selection. In
      our case it is the number of

      periods till the next date frequency granularity i.e. if frequency is daily,
      it will be a week (7),

      if it is a week, it will be month (4). That values multiplied by two is the
      largest

      possible values of lags/rolling windows. In our examples, we will consider the
      maximum lag

      order of 14 and 8 respectively).


      Create a de-seasonalized series by adding trend and residual components. This
      will be used

      in the next step.


      Estimate the PACF - Partial Auto Correlation Function on the on the data from
      (2)

      and search for points, where the auto correlation is significant i.e. its absolute

      value is more then 1.96/square_root(maximal lag value), which correspond to
      significance of 95%.


      If all points are significant, we consider it being strong seasonality

      and do not create look back features.


      We scan the PACF values from the beginning and the value before the first insignificant

      auto correlation will designate the lag. If first significant element (value
      correlate with

      itself) is followed by insignificant, the lag will be 0 and we will not use
      look back features.'
