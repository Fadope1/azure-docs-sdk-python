- description: 'Required. Pipeline topology describes the processing steps to be

    applied when processing media for a particular outcome. The topology should be
    defined

    according to the scenario to be achieved and can be reused across many pipeline
    instances which

    share the same processing characteristics. For instance, a pipeline topology which
    acquires

    data from a RTSP camera, process it with an specific AI model and stored the data
    on the cloud

    can be reused across many different cameras, as long as the same processing should
    be applied

    across all the cameras. Individual instance properties can be defined through
    the use of

    user-defined parameters, which allow for a topology to be parameterized, thus
    allowing

    individual pipelines to refer to different values, such as individual cameras
    RTSP endpoints

    and credentials. Overall a topology is composed of the following:Parameters: list
    of user defined parameters that can be references across the topologynodes.

    * Sources: list of one or more data sources nodes such as an RTSP source which
    allows for

    media to be ingested from cameras.

    * Processors: list of nodes which perform data analysis or transformations.-Sinks:
    list of one or more data sinks which allow for data to be stored or exported toother
    destinations.'
